= Ironclad Connector

== Introduction
The Anypoint Ironclad Connector provides the capability to connect a Mule application to Ironclad, enabling retrieval of contract information and modification of existing contract schemas. This connector facilitates seamless integration with Ironclad's contract lifecycle management system, allowing businesses to automate contract-related workflows efficiently.
The connector exposes the following operations:

* Create Record
* Create Webhook
* Create a Workflow Asynchronously
* List All Records
* List All Workflow Approvals
* List All Workflow Signers
* List All Workflows
* Retrieve Record
* Retrieve Records Schema
* Retrieve Workflow
* Retrieve Workflow Schema
* Retrieve the Status of an Async Workflow Create Job
* Update Approval on a Workflow
* Update Record Metadata
* Update Workflow Metadata

== Prerequisites

|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime	     |  4.4 or later
|Ironclad API         |  v1
|Java	             |  1.8 and later
|===

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need the connected app to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

== Initial Steps to generate Ironclad connected app

Create an account in https://ironcladapp.com/, once created go to https://developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/register-oauth-client to configure a new connected app to start using the connector.

== Configuration
